        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Everstorm Music Share is a 'proof of concept' music hosting app for local musicians.</p>
        <p>If this project were to grow beyond the scope of this capstone, we would like to add other local artist, bios, and music to share</p>
        <p>With the DynamoDB already connected to this app, we could add location and genre based search queries to allow users to find local music in their area.</p>

        <h2>Our Music</h2>
        <p>allpersonsficctitious started out as a small studio project between Grey and Scott.</p>
        <p>Grey had envisioned music to go along with some of his favorite fantasy novels and requested help from his long time friend to make that dream come true.</p>
        <p>Everstorm is a Parshendi war song, based in the world of Brandon Sandersons' Stormlight Archive.</p>
        <p> Lyrics and vocals are by Grey, while Scott produced, recorded and mixed everything else.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Oceus (Only Child Syndrome) is purely the creation of Scott, writting, composing and recording all instruments, lyrics and vocals.</p>
